/* absolute: An element with position: absolute; is positioned
           relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead
           of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).
fixed: An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same
        place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.
relative:  is positioned relative to its normal position
            Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of
            a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position.
static: HTML elements are positioned static by default.
        Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties. 
sticky: more like fixed by is contained within the container while scrolling
